        <br><br>
        If you are already a licensed partner with Microsoft or indirectly through an authorized Microsoft distributor, you do not need to go through this commercialization process. Just contact your Microsoft representative or distributor for more information. Otherwise, to get started, sign in below to review and accept the commercialization terms.</p-->
