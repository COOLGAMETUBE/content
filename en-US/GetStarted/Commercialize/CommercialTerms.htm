    <h1  class="c-subheading-1">Register to use Windows IoT Core Commercially</h1>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">We’re thrilled that you’ve decided to commercialize your device with Windows 10 IoT Core and we hope that you’ve had a good development experience so far.  Deploying Windows 10 IoT Core is easy - all you need is a Microsoft account (formally Windows Live ID). 
        <br><br>
        If you are already a licensed partner with Microsoft or indirectly through an authorized Microsoft distributor, you do not need to go through this commercialization process. Just contact your Microsoft representative or distributor for more information. Otherwise, to get started, sign in below to review and accept the commercialization terms.</p>
