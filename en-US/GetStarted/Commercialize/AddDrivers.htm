    <h1 class="c-subheading-1">Add necessary drivers</h1>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">In this lab, we'll add the sample driver <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/samples/driverlab" class="c-hyperlink">Hello, Blinky!</a>, package it up, and deploy it Windows 10 IoT Core.</p>
</header>
<section class="pad-thin">
    <h3 class="c-subheading-3">Check for similar drivers</h3>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">Before adding drivers, you may want to review your pre-built board support package (BSP) to make sure there's not already a similar driver. You can review the list of drivers in this file: \IoT-ADK-AddonKit\Source-arm\BSP\<device-name>\Packages\<DeviceFM>.xml.</p>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">If there's not an existing driver, you can add one. If there is a driver but it doesn't meet your needs, you'll need to replace the driver by creating a new BSP.</p>
</section>
<section class="pad-thin">
    <h3 class="c-subheading-3">Create your test files</h3>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">Complete the exercises in the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/samples/driverlab1" class="c-hyperlink">Installing the Sample Driver Lab</a> to build the Hello, Blinky! App.</p>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">You'll create three files: </p>
    <ul class="c-list">
        <li>ACPITABL.dat</li>
        <li>Gpiokmdfdemo.inf</li>
        <li>Gpiokmdfdemo.sys</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">You'll use these files to install the driver. You can also use your own IoT Core driver, so long as it doesn't conflict with the existing Board Support Package (BSP). Copy each of the files.</p>

<section class="pad-thin">
    <h3 class="c-subheading-3">Build a package for your driver</h3>
    <ol class="c-list">
        <li>Run C:\IoT-ADK-AddonKit\IoTCoreShell as an administrator.</li>
        <li>Create the driver package using the .inf file as the base:`newdrypkg C:\gpiokmdfdemo\gpiokmdfdemo.inf Drivers.HelloBlinky`</li>
        <li>Copy the file ACPITABL.dat to the new folder C:\IoT-ADK-AddonKit\Source-<arch>\Packages\Drivers.HelloBlinky\.</li>

            <p class="c-paragraph-3">The default package definition file includes sample XML that you can modify to add your own driver files. If necessary, update the value of file source to point to your .SYS file and the ACPITABL.dat file (you don't need to add the .INF file). Add the DestinationDir of $(runtime.drviers).</p>

        <li>Open the architecture-specific feature manifest file. C:\IoT-ADK-AddonKit\Source-<arch>\Packages\OEMFM.xml.</li>
        <li>Create a new PackageFile section in the XML with your package file listed and give it a new FeatureID such as "OEM_DriverHelloBlinky".

        <li>Run `buildfm bsp <device-name>` to generate updated files in the MergedFMs folder. This must be done every time any time an FM file is modified. You'll now be able to add your driver to your product by adding a reference to this feature manifest.</li>
