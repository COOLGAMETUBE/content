    <h1  class="c-subheading-1">Build your image</h1>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">To get started, we'll create a basic IoT Core image, flash it to a micro SD card, and put it into a device to make sure that everything is working properly.</p>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">We'll create a product folder that represents our first design. For our first product design, we'll customize just enough for the IoT Core device to boot up and run the built-in OOBE app, which we should be able to see on an HDMI-compatible monitor.</p>

<section class="pad-thin">
    <h3 class="c-subheading-3">1. Set your OEM name (one-time only)</h3>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">Open the file below in a text editor and modify it with your company name or name of choosing.</p>
    <blockquote class="c-blockquote">
            <p class="c-paragraph">C:\IoT-ADK-AddonKit\Tools]setOEM.cmd</p>
    </blockquote>  
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">We've added this variable to help you create packages with names that are easy to differentiate from those provided by other manufactures you're working with.</p>
    <blockquote class="c-blockquote">
            <p class="c-paragraph">set OEM_NAME = Fabrikam</p>
    </blockquote>

<section>
    <h3 class="c-subheading-3">2. Start the IoT Core shell</h3>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">In Windows Explorer, go to the folder where you installed the IoT Core ADK Add-Ons and open IoTCoreShell.cmd. It should prompt you to run as an administrator. The new value for OEM_NAME should appear when you start the tool.</p>
    <blockquote class="c-blockquote">
            <p class="c-paragraph">Note: If you get the error, "The system cannot find the path specified," right-click the icon and modify the path in "Target" to the location you've chosen to install the tools.</p>
    </blockquote>

<section>
    <h3 class="c-subheading-3">3. Install test certificates</h3>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">You only need to install certificates the first time you install the IoT ADK add-on kit. You'll use these to sign your test binaries. The certificates will be added to the root.</p>
    <blockquote class="c-blockquote">
            <p class="c-paragraph">installcemcerts</p>

<section class="pad-thin"> 
    <h3 class="c-subheading-3">4. Choose your architecture</h3>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">At the "Set Environment for Architecture" prompt, select 1 for ARM, 2 for x86 or 3 for x64 based on the architecture of the boards you'll be developing.</p>
    <blockquote class="c-blockquote">
            <p class="c-paragraph">Note: The launch tool sets the default architecture, and sets a version number for the design, which you can use for future updates. The first version number defaults to 10.0.0.0.</p>

<section class="pad-thin">
    <h3 class="c-subheading-3">5. Build your board supported package (BSP)</h3>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">Extract your BSP to a folder on your hard drive. From the IoT Core Shell, navigate to C:\BSP and run build.cmd. This will add the packages necessary to create a project with your device's BSP.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3 class="c-subheading-3">6. Build an image</h3>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">Eject any removable storage drives including the Micro SD card and any USB flash drives. Build a flashable test image using the default files. Test images include additional tools which will help to create test images using either signed or unsigned test packages.</p>

            This builds an FFU file with your basic image.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="c-blockquote">
            <p class="c-paragraph">Note: If you get the error code 0x8007005 or 0x800705b4, unplug all external drives and try again. If this doesn't work, refer to the previous step and make sure everything's installed.</p>

<section>
    <h3 class="c-subheading-3">7. Flash the image to a memory card</h3>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">Start the Windows IoT Core Dashboard and plug your micro SD card into your technician PC. Select it in the tool once it comes up.</p>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">From "Setup a new device," select "Device type" as a customer. From "Flash the pre-downloaded file" (Flash.ffu) to the SD card, click Browse and browse to your FFU file.</p>
    <blockquote class="c-blockquote">
            <xmp>C:\IoT-ADK-AddonKiT\Build\<arch>\ProductA\Test\Flash.ffu</xmp>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">Once you find it, click <b>Next</b>. You can also change the default device name.</p>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">Enter your device password, accept the license terms, and then click <b>Install</b>. The Windows IoT Core Dashboard formats the micro SD card and installs the new image.</p>
</section>
<section class="pad-thin">
    <h3 class="c-subheading-3">8. Try it out</h3>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">Connect your device into a monitor using a HDMI cable. When possible, use a direct connection to a HDMI port. The display may not appear when using DVI/VGA adapters or hubs.</p>
    <p class="c-paragraph-3">Put it in the micro SD card with your image and power it on. After a short while, the device should start automatically and you should see the IoT Core Default app, which shows basic information about the image.</p>
    <blockquote class="c-blockquote">
            <p class="c-paragraph">Note: Some devices, particularly those using 8 GB class 10 SD cards, may be very slow to boot up on the first boot. Slow boot times may be over 15 minutes. Subsequent boots will be much quicker on the affected cards.</p>
