# Capturing Fiddler Traces on Windows IoT Core

## Assumptions 

* You have [PuTTY][1] on your developer box or an alternative for SSH
* The instructions below make the assumption of a IoT Core VM but will work on *any* IoT Core device

[1]: http://www.putty.org/ "Download PuTTY"

## Initial Setup

1. Download and install the latest version of [Fiddler][2] on your developer box if you haven't already
2. Start Fiddler and make the following setting updates under _Tools -> Telerik Fiddler Options -> HTTPS_ tab
	* Check _Capture HTTPS CONNECTs_
	* Check _Decrypt HTTPS Traffic -> from all processes_
	* Click on the 'Certificates generated by' link and select _MakeCert engine_ 
		(Recommendation: Restart Fiddler for this change to take effect)
	* Next, export the FiddlerRoot.cer file via _Actions -> Export Root Certificate To Desktop_
3. Make the following setting updates under _Tools -> Telerik Fiddler Options -> Connections_ tab:
	* Setup Fiddler to act as a system proxy by checking _Allow Remote Computers to Connect_
	* _Fiddler listens on port_ should be set to _8888_

Note: You should restart Fiddler after this and accept any UAC prompt.

## Transfer and Import Fiddler Root Certificate
You'll need to import the Fiddler root certificate to your IoT image or device in order to debug https traffic routing through your PC.  To do this:

1. Mount the VHD file (right click on the VHD and choose _mount_) or connect to your IoT device via PuTTY (or alternative SSH client)
2. Browse to the mainOS partition and create a _test_ folder at root (via SSH, use _md c:\test_)
3. Copy FiddlerRoot.cer you generated above (should be on your desktop by default) to the test folder location
4. If using a VHD, unmount it by ejecting any of the mounted drives and then start the IoT Core VM via HyperV
5. Start an [SSH session][3] and login as administrator 
6. Navigate to c:\test directory in your SSH session
7. Import Fiddler Root Certificate via command:
	* `certmgr -add FiddlerRoot.cer -r localmachine -s root`
8. Close SSH session

## Setup Proxy on VM or IoT Core Device
The steps below will allow your IoT VM or device to route traffic through your PC so that Fiddler can capture network traffic for analysis:

1. Determine the IP of your development machine using a CMD console via _ipconfig_
2. Start a new SSH session and this time, login as defaultUser (Username: _DefaultAccount_  Pwd: _[blank]_ )
3. Set the proxy via the following commands:
	* `reg add "hkcu\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings" /v ProxyEnable /t REG\_DWORD /d 1`
	* `reg add "hkcu\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings" /v ProxyServer /t REG\_SZ /d [PC IP address]:8888`

If not already running, start Fiddler on your PC, restart your VM or IoT Core device and traffic should now be routed through Fiddler. 

Note: If you see https CONNECT in Fiddler but no data, the certificate was likely not installed correctly. Make sure you didn't miss the _Transfer and Import Fiddler Root Certificate_ steps above.
