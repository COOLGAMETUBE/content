    <li><b>Find your board and click "Configure Device".</b> If your board has a WiFi adapater and it has not yet been set up, it will start to broadcast itself as a network (shown in the figure to the right). Unconfigured boards will begin with "AJ_" (e.g. AJ_58EA6C68).
    If you don’t see your board, make sure that you’ve allowed enough time for your board to boot. If all else fails, reboot your device.
    <li><b>Enter your network credentials.</b> Your computer will now connect to your board.</li>
